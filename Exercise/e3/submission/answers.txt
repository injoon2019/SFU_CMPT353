1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?

-> I think, for smoothing the CPU temperature, Kalman smoothing is better because it's more sensitive when dealing with outliers.

2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.]
-> If those values have enough covariance, we can use them to make a better prediction. For example, speed and heaeding in degrees might be helpful to predct next latitude and longitude.
